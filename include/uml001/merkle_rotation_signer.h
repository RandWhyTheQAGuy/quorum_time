 * Quorum Time — Open Trusted Time & Distributed Verification Framework

 *
 * Quorum Time is an open, verifiable, Byzantine‑resilient trusted‑time
 * system designed for modern distributed environments. It provides a
 * cryptographically anchored notion of time that can be aligned,
 * audited, and shared across domains without requiring centralized
 * trust.
 *
 * This project also includes the Aegis Semantic Passport components,
 * which complement Quorum Time by offering structured, verifiable
 * identity and capability attestations for agents and services.
 *
 * Core capabilities:
 *   - BFT Quorum Time: multi‑authority, tamper‑evident time agreement
 *                      with drift bounds, authority attestation, and
 *                      cross‑domain alignment (AlignTime).
 *
 *   - Transparency Logging: append‑only, hash‑chained audit records
 *                           for time events, alignment proofs, and
 *                           key‑rotation operations.
 *
 *   - Semantic Passports: optional identity and capability metadata
 *                         for systems that require verifiable agent
 *                         provenance and authorization context.
 *
 *   - Open Integration: designed for interoperability with distributed
 *                       systems, security‑critical infrastructure,
 *                       autonomous agents, and research environments.
 *
 * Quorum Time is developed as an open‑source project with a focus on
 * clarity, auditability, and long‑term maintainability. Contributions,
 * issue reports, and discussions are welcome.

 * This implementation is intended for open research, practical
 * deployment, and community‑driven evolution of verifiable time and
 * distributed trust standards.
